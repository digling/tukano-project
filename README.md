# Tukano-Project

Reposotory for the Tukano project (discussions and automatic data analyses)

## Issue Tracker and Mile Stones as Basic Organization Principle

In order to communicate, check, and coordinate the work that has to be done, but also to discuss *how* it should be done, we will use the github issue tracker. Here, when you go to the issue tab on top, you will see all open issues, and you can also see, until when they should be done. Every issue will be tight to a Milestone. This has a date, for which we aim to have completed all issues. Every collaborator may be assigned to a certain issue. And once this collaborator has finished the issue and updated their data accordingly, they can **close** the issue, and in this way we can keep track of what has been done.

We can also use the issues for questions and discussions. If you have a problem concerning all of us, please, file an issue, and label it as "discussion" with the tag label (blue) on the right. Then we can use GitHub to discuss these problems.
