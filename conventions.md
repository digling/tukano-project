# Conventions for Data Handling

Here we list and collect our conventions for data creation and representation in different stages of the projects. See our [workflow description](https://github.com/digling/tukano-project/blob/master/workflow.md) for the general workflow we decided to follow.

## IPA Conventions for the quasi-phonemic (FUN, $$) field

1. diphthongs vs two consecutive vowels belonging to different syllables
2. long vowels a: not aa
3. affricates (and other coarticulated consonants that are to be considered one segment) t͡ʃ and not tʃ
